The idea is to collect good optimization scripts and combine them in a single ps1 script.

Use at your own risk, if anything breaks it's on you.

Must be run in powershell as admin and with Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

some of the scripts are made by me and some are from @fr33thyfr33thy and @zoicware -> amazing guys defintely go and check their work

Can also be run by running this command in Admin p$ window:

```iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivance/WinOpt/main/WinFix.ps1 | iex```
