The idea is to collect good optimization scripts and combine them in a single ps1 script
'''==WORK IN PROGRESS=='''
Use at your own risk, if anything breaks it's on you.

Must be run in powershell as admin and with Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

most of the scripts are from @fr33thyfr33thy, @zoicware - amazing guys and some I made myself

Can also be run by running this command in Admin p$ window
```iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivance/WinOpt/main/WinFix.ps1 | iex```
