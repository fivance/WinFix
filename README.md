The idea is to collect good optimization scripts and combine them in a single ps1 script
==WORK IN PROGRESS==
Use at your own risk, if anything breaks it's on you.

INFO: if you see error messages at certain parts script probably tried to delete/change a reg key/app/feature that is already deleted/removed, not to worry

Must be run as admin and with Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Script contains the following: 

Menu style ps script that looks like this:

------------------------------------------
0. Winget install apps (comment a certain $app/s if you dont want it installed or add your own in the main script)
1. CTT WinInstall script 
2. Clean GPU drivers with DDU
3. Install NVIDIA driver
4. Nvidia optimal settings
5. Comprehensive optimization script
6. Extra tweaks (ignore errors - they pertain to services that you have no access as a local user and services that dont exist)
7. Disable Defender
8. Experimental services disable tweaks (dont use if you dont know what you're doing)
9. Exit

most of the scripts are from @fr33thyfr33thy, @zoicware - amazing guys
Some are made by me
